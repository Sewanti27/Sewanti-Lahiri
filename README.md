## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Node.js 18+ (recommended) 
NPM (bundled) or Yarn / PNPM if you prefer.

### Install
```
npm install
```

### Development
```
npm run dev
```
Visit: http://localhost:5173 (default Vite dev port)

### Production Build
```
npm run build
npm run preview   # (optional) serve production build locally
```

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack

- React 18
- Vite
- ESLint (flat config)
- Plain CSS (scoped by section file) â€“ no CSS-in-JS

## ðŸ“¬ Inquiry Form (Google Forms Integration)

The Discuss section posts to a hidden Google Form endpoint using a `fetch` POST with `no-cors`. Success feedback is optimistic (since `no-cors` suppresses response visibility). To adapt:
1. Create your own Google Form with matching fields.
2. Inspect the form page source and copy each `entry.<id>` for the inputs.
3. Update the mapping inside `Discuss.jsx`.

## â™¿ Accessibility Notes

- All interactive elements have discernible labels.
- Keyboard navigation supported for carousels via arrow buttons & focusable controls.
- Color contrasts tuned for dark backgrounds.

## ðŸ“‚ Notable File Map

```
src/
	main.jsx            # App bootstrap
	App.jsx             # Section composition
	sections/           # All major page sections
	styles/             # Per-section CSS files
public/               # Static assets (images, svg, etc.)
```

## ðŸ”„ Future Improvements (Ideas)

- Add dark/light theme toggle
- Motion reductions (prefers-reduced-motion)
- Convert inline carousels to reusable hook
- Deploy via GitHub Pages / Netlify / Vercel automation
- Integrate analytics (privacy-friendly)

## ðŸ“¦ Deploying to GitHub Pages (Optional)
Quick path (after repo is pushed):
```
npm run build
```
Upload `dist/` to a static host OR configure an action (e.g. `peaceiris/actions-gh-pages`).
